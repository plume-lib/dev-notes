~/java/plume-lib/reflection-util/src/main/java/org/plumelib/reflection/ReflectionPlume.java

 * concatenate paragraphs if the second one ends with //nobreak

require-javadoc:
Update documentation, because maybe as of JDK 18, `javac -Xdoclint:all` gives "warning: no comment"
JavaParser is not being extended to Java 18+.  So probably rewrite using javac's parser.

Low priority:

MultiVersionControl: rewrite the recursive search routine using newer Java interfaces.

Benchmark ArraySet vs HashSet.
