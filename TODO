MultiVersionControl:
Insert each import statement where it belongs, alphabetically, rather than inserting them all as a block.

EntryReader: should have a "trim whitespace" option and a "skip blank lines" option.

Fix to handle arbitrary number of inner classes:
~/java/plume-lib/reflection-util/src/main/java/org/plumelib/reflection/ReflectionPlume.java

Change lookup program:
 * ignore lines starting with // rather than those starting with %
 * concatenate paragraphs if the second one ends with //nobreak

require-javadoc:
Update documentation, because maybe as of JDK 18, `javac -Xdoclint:all` gives "warning: no comment"
JavaParser is not being extended to Java 18+.  So probably rewrite using javac's parser.

in multi-version-control, do:
git fetch --tags --force

plume-util:
Define OrderedPairIterable, encourage clients to use it instead of OrderedPairIterator (but don't deprecate the latter).

merging:
perhaps don't re-insert if a wildcard import has been inserted.  ImportsTest13 is an example of this.

----------------

Low priority:

MultiVersionControl: rewrite the recursive search routine using newer Java interfaces.

Benchmark ArraySet vs HashSet.
