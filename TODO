EntryReader: should have a "trim whitespace" option and a "skip blank lines" option.

Fix to handle arbitrary number of inner classes:
~/java/plume-lib/reflection-util/src/main/java/org/plumelib/reflection/ReflectionPlume.java

Change lookup program:
 * ignore lines starting with // rather than those starting with %
 * concatenate paragraphs if the second one ends with //nobreak

require-javadoc:
Update documentation, because maybe as of JDK 18, `javac -Xdoclint:all` gives "warning: no comment"

----------------

Low priority:

MultiVersionControl: rewrite the recursive search routine using newer Java interfaces.

Rewrite WeakHasherMap and WeakIdentityHashMap from scratch so they can be reinstated into plume-util.
Or, find an alternative, such as in Guava.
(This was hard to do.)
